# Functional Programming in the Tidyverse

### Resources for learning and doing functional programming in the tidyverse

As a data scientist or quant researcher, functional programming is a thing you should care about. Why?

- Problem solving centred on functions is a good fit for data analysis
- It matches the way we tend to think about the questions we ask of data
- It tends to improve the readability of code (for instance by replacing for loops with a single line of code that makes the intent obvious to the reader)

In R, functions behave like other data structures. That means you can assign them to a variable, create them inside other functions, return them as a result of a function, add them to lists, etc. 

This opens up a whole world of possibilities including: 

- mapping input data to output data by applying custom functions to elements of the input
- applying functions to individual elements in a collection of data
- rolling and sliding window calculations
- many many more

This repository contains resources for learning about and doing functional programming in the tidyverse, including recipes, tutorials, and example applications.

# Functional Programming Recipes

- Make a dataframe of random numbers
- Extract a named/indexed element from nested lists - JSON
- Easy exlploratory data analysis in purrr: mean, type, ndistinct etc of every column
- Rolling window calculations using a function that take a single argument eg `mean` - `slide_dbl`
- Rolling window calculations using a fucntion that takes 2 arguments eg `cor` - `slide2_dbl`
- Rolling beta, rolling correlation, rolling sharpe, rolling vol, rolling zscore
- Compare the above with calculating on the entire data set using `purrr::map`
- I have a for loop that loops over columns: `map`
- I want to group a variable by another variable - eg price by stock, return by year, return by month etc
- Seasonality stuff
- Difference between purrr::map and dplyr:summarise - `map` operateds on all columns, `dplyr::summarise` summarises specified columns..which leads to some interesting use cases of dplyr's scoped variants
- Trick for building custom mapping functions
